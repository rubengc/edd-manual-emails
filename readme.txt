Send emails to anyone using your EDD email template

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads") v2.3 or greater.

Once activated, EDD Manual Emails will add a new section under EDD emails settings page where you can build an email and send it to anyone using your preconfigured EDD email template.

In addition, you can send this email to one or more contacts and EDD Manual Emails will notice you how many emails have been sent successfully.

Update: Added the possibility to send the email to al registered users or to all EDD FES vendors with a simple checkbox

Note: This is a lightweight plugin that adds this little feature, for a more complete emails system I recommend [EDD Message](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/edd-message/) plugin.

There's a [GIT repository](https://github.com/rubengc/edd-manual-emails) too if you want to contribute a patch.
